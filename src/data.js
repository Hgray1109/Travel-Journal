My sister lived here and I was able to enjoy an in-depth tour of the city while having some of the best pizza in my life.",

It was a small city perfectly designed to tickle the curiosity of any traveler. The food was amazing, but the attitude of the people was not the best. I left many sites and tourist attractions to be seen if I ever choose to venture back to this beautiful city.",

It was made all the better when I was there for OctoberFest. The energy in these giant beer halls was unmached. I had an amazing time drinking with locals as well as a great friend of mine. Besides the halls, I had a wonderful time taking the train to see different parts of the countryside. It is a place I would go back to without question.",

        description: "Nasty or cool? I am not sure if I can truly decide. The famous Gum Wall in Seattle is a must see. However, I wouldn't recommend you stay too long if you have a sensative stomache. It was great to be immersed in culture, standing in between a sticky symbol of the millions of past travelers and locals. Nearby, you can find the first ever StarBucks as well as a booming little market. Between the Seahawks losing Russel Willson and the gloomy weather, I wouldn't go back.",

I found myself traveling alone making a last minute decision to go to an island while it wasn't tourist season. I had an entire villa to myself. One person dedicated to cooking. During the day, the tide was 60ft high, but when the morning came I found myself on the beach exploring all the caves that had been opened. I would go back to Colombia to see everything else that this beautiful country has to offer. ",
